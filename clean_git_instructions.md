# Clean Git Repository and Push Instructions

Since there are terminal access issues, please run these commands manually in your terminal:

## Step 1: Clean the existing git repository
```bash
cd "/Users/charan/Desktop/icon final"
rm -rf .git
```

## Step 2: Initialize a fresh git repository
```bash
git init
```

## Step 3: Add the GitHub repository as remote
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/praveenmanchi/Iconboard.site.git
```

## Step 4: Stage all files
```bash
git add .
```

## Step 5: Create initial commit
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: IconBoard SVG icon library application

- Complete React-based icon library application
- Modern UI with dark mode support
- Real-time search functionality
- Category-based browsing
- PWA support with manifest files
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Comprehensive icon collection with 1000+ icons"
```

## Step 6: Push to GitHub
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main --force
```

## Alternative: Use the provided script
If you prefer, you can run the provided script:
```bash
chmod +x clean_and_push.sh
